# Project 5 First-Person Maze
This is a basic solution of project 5 for MSCH C-220 Game Technology. The goal is to create a "maze" that includes a 3d playable character, an attempt at constructive solid geometry, an enemy, a key, and an exit. Amongst other things. 



## Implementation
On top of the basic required features I included:
- Music I created in MuseScore
- Sound effects I made in Audacity

## References
The zombie was made using resources from kenney.nl in the Blocky Characters asset library

The key was made using resources from kenney.nl in the Platformer Kit asset library

I utilized https://www.audacityteam.org/ for the Zombie and Key sounds

I utilized https://musescore.org/en for the background music 

## Future Development
This is a project that I didn't have a whole lot of creative inspiration for when I started, but when I started to hear the background music with the creepy pipe organ, I thought of a couple cool features that I might work on given time.
- Victorian Vampire Mansion Theme with:
  - Updated enemy (more visually interesting with rudimentary AI)
  - Darker Lighting utilizing a roof to cut off the skylight and some type of torch, candle, lamp to illuminate the maze.
  - Dark wood grain wall textures
  - More unique challenges
